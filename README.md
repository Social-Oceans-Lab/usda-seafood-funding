This repository contains code for the analysis of a manuscript titled "*Fish, funding, and food systems: A review of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's recent history of grant funding in support of the seafood sector (2018-2023)*" that has been published in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems. doi: [10.3389/fsufs.2025.1558756](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2025.1558756/full). The open access database generated by this project and analyzed in the manuscript is linked at the bottom of this page.

## Project Aim

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers a number of grant programs that aim to strengthen local and regional food systems. The purpose of this project is to conduct background research to help identify ways USDA can better support the seafood sector through its existing grant-making pathways.

## Research Questions

1.  What are the number of USDA grants distributed to seafood businesses / entities?
2.  What is the total value of grants distributed to seafood businesses / entities?
3.  What is the relative proportion of grants given to terrestrial food systems vs. aquatic food systems?
4.  For grants that support seafood, how many are for aquaculture, wild-caught fisheries, or both?
5.  For grants that support seafood, which portions of the supply chain and what type of grantees receive grant funding?

## Data Sources

Using publicly available data, we investigated USDA's grant-making history to understand the extent to which the seafood sector has benefited from them. We focused our search on USDA agencies that are known to have a history of supporting seafood businesses / organizations (Table 1). Given the scope of this project, we proposed to focus our work on the years 2018 to 2023. The primary databases and websites that were compiled to create the database used in this analysis are listed below.
